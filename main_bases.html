        <h2>> Klein-Honningstal - "Small Valley of Honningen" by AlbertAllrad.</h2>
        <p>
        Being one of the more recent additions to the Kaida-area, Klein-Honningstal rose from one small house in the forest covering the gate to the 1-Year-Area.<br>
        Back then there were no plans to ever grow to the scale it has reached today.<br><br>

        Being inspired of IRL German castle towns like Meissen and Eisenach, the town still is growing to this day.<br>
        It consists of multiple levels:<br><br>

        The first area is made up of the town's top carpenters, blacksmiths, brewers and more.<br> 
        Built around the original home of today's Castle Lord, it is the first stop for visitors and messengers from the other areas.<br>
        It also contains the townhall.<br><br>

        The Second area Wraps around the inner Walls and is purely residential buildings (or so the castle's army would have you believe).<br> 
        It is secured by a high wall to the outside and has a secret emergency passage to the primary castle area, giving it's residents the best possible chances of survival during a siege.<br><br>

        At the peaks of the mountains overlooking the 1-Year-Area you can find the main Castle Buildings: To the North the Burgfried (The Donjon) with the Lord's residence and stables.<br> 
        South of it is the secondary keep, acting as a central storage hub, also featuring most of the town's trade commerce.<br> 
        It is directly connected to Klein-Honningtal's numerous farms, providing an immediate supply of goods to the town and it's people.<br><br>

        Klein-Honningstal is ever-expanding and invites Visitors and Travellers alike to stay a few nights, trade with the locals, and enjoy the rustic German way of life which the town is famous for.

        <h2>> Barad-dur - "The Dark Tower of Sauron" by ZakZNinja.</h2>
        <p>
        A recreation of Sauron's fortress from the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy.<br> 
        Barad-Dur began construction on the Project-Kaida server shortly after the completion of the Pyramid,<br>
        both to rival its presence and to create a second monolith visible from spawn.<br>
        It is part of the land and faction of "Mordor" accessible by crossing the viaduct connecting to the spawn island, marked by the "Black Gate."<br><br>
        
        Upon entering Mordor, you will see a moat of lava surrounding Barad-Dur, protecting it from invaders and feeding the forges in the tower's lower chambers.<br> 
        This moat is fuelled by only the most fearsome of fires,<br>
        harvested from "Mount Doom," which resides in the Nether - accessible through the sandstone-encased portal beside the viaduct.<br><br>
        
        The fortress's outer gate is guarded by a door of lava that opens into the entrance hall, from which all detailed interior floors can be accessed.<br>
        These currently include:<br>
        - a vast storeroom for stockpiling the spoils of war and industry,<br>
        - a throne room used to give commands and display authority and power,<br>
        - personal bedchambers, as even Sauron's eyes must rest,<br>
        - a library containing powerful and dark magical knowledge,<br>
        along with one of the few remaining Palantiri — bewitched seeing stones that allow strong-willed users to communicate and gaze over long distances.<br><br>
        
        At the summit of Barad-Dur, the "Eye of Sauron" uses the power of the Palantiri and the One Ring to watch over the server and ensure that no other factions rise against Mordor.<br>
        This also allows the Dark Lord to track the movements of the Orcs and Nazgul — his armies and servants — keeping them bound to his rule.<br><br>
        
        In contrast to the scorched land of Mordor, the surrounding area is very fertile due to nutrient-rich volcanic soil.<br>
        This has led to the prosperity of nearby woodlands and an oasis.<br>
        These natural resources are used to feed the armies and fuel the war machine (but no need to worry about that).<br><br>
        
        If you decide to simply walk into Mordor, the Black Gate is always open to those who wish to gaze upon the magnificence of the dark fortress from within its grounds.<br><br>
        
        Etymology: Barad-dur means "Dark Fortress" in Sindarin, from barad ("fortress/tower") and dur ("dark").<br>
        Sindarin being the most common variant of the Elven tongue in the Third Age.
